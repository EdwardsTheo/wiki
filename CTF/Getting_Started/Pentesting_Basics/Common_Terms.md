There are two categories of ports, [Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol), and [User Datagram Protocol (UDP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol).  

TCP is connection-oriented, meaning that a connection between a client and a server must be established before data can be sent. The server must be in a listening state awaiting connection requests from clients.  

UDP utilizes a connectionless communication model. There is no "handshake" and therefore introduces a certain amount of unreliability since there is no guarantee of data delivery. UDP is useful when error correction/checking is either not needed or is handled by the application itself. UDP is suitable for applications that run time-sensitive tasks since dropping packets is faster than waiting for delayed packets due to retransmission, as is the case with TCP and can significantly affect a real-time system. There are 65,535 TCP ports and 65,535 different UDP ports, each denoted by a number. Some of the most well-known TCP and UDP ports are listed below:

  

| Port(s) |  Protocol  
| --------- |  ----------
| 20/21 (TCP)  | FTP
|22 (TCP) |SSH
|23 (TCP)|Telnet
|25 (TCP)|SMTP
|80 (TCP)|HTTP
|161 (TCP/UDP)|SNMP
|389 (TCP/UDP)|LDAP
|443 (TCP)|SSL/TLS (HTTPS)
|445 (TCP)|SMB
|3389 (TCP)|RDP

  

# What is a Web Server

A web server is an application that runs on the back-end server, which handles all of the HTTP traffic from the client-side browser, routes it to the requests destination pages, and finally responds to the client-side browser. Web servers usually run on TCP ports 80 or 443, and are responsible for connecting end-users to various parts of the web application, in addition to handling their various responses:

  

# OWASP 10

This list is considered the top 10 most dangerous vulnerabilities and is not an exhaustive list of all possible web application vulnerabilities. Web application security assessment methodologies are often based around the OWASP top 10 as a starting point for the top categories of flaws that an assessor should be checking for. The current OWASP Top 10 list is: (in 2022)

  

| Number |  Category |  Description 
| --------- |  ---------- | --------------- 
|  1. |  [Broken Access Control](https://owasp.org/Top10/A01_2021-Broken_Access_Control/) |  Restrictions are not appropriately implemented to prevent users from accessing other users accounts, viewing sensitive data, accessing unauthorized functionality, modifying data, etc. |
|2.  |[Cryptographic Failures](https://owasp.org/Top10/A02_2021-Cryptographic_Failures/) | Failures related to cryptography which often leads to sensitive data exposure or system compromise. |
|3.  | [Injection](https://owasp.org/Top10/A03_2021-Injection/) | User-supplied data is not validated, filtered, or sanitized by the application. Some examples of injections are SQL injection, command injection, LDAP injection, etc.
|4.| [Insecure Design](https://owasp.org/Top10/A04_2021-Insecure_Design/) |These issues happen when the application is not designed with security in mind.
| 5. | [Security Misconfiguration](https://owasp.org/Top10/A05_2021-Security_Misconfiguration/) | Missing appropriate security hardening across any part of the application stack, insecure default configurations, open cloud storage, verbose error messages which disclose too much information.
| 6. | [Vulnerable and Outdated Components](https://owasp.org/Top10/A06_2021-Vulnerable_and_Outdated_Components/) | Using components (both client-side and server-side) that are vulnerable, unsupported, or out of date.
| 7. | [Identification and Authentication Failures](https://owasp.org/Top10/A07_2021-Identification_and_Authentication_Failures/) | Authentication-related attacks that target user's identity, authentication, and session management.
| 8. | [Software and Data Integrity Failures](https://owasp.org/Top10/A08_2021-Software_and_Data_Integrity_Failures/) |Software and data integrity failures relate to code and infrastructure that does not protect against integrity violations. An example of this is where an application relies upon plugins, libraries, or modules from untrusted sources, repositories, and content delivery networks (CDNs).
| 9. | [Security Logging and Monitoring Failures](https://owasp.org/Top10/A09_2021-Security_Logging_and_Monitoring_Failures/)  | This category is to help detect, escalate, and respond to active breaches. Without logging and monitoring, breaches cannot be detected..
| 10. | [Server-Side Request Forgery](https://owasp.org/Top10/A10_2021-Server-Side_Request_Forgery_%28SSRF%29/) | SSRF flaws occur whenever a web application is fetching a remote resource without validating the user-supplied URL. It allows an attacker to coerce the application to send a crafted request to an unexpected destination, even when protected by a firewall, VPN, or another type of network access control list (ACL).
