Computers are assigned an IP address, which allows them to be uniquely identified and accessible on a network. The services running on these computers may be assigned a port number to make the service accessible. As discussed prior, port numbers range from 1 to 65,535, with the range of well-known ports 1 to 1,023 being reserved for privileged services. Port 0 is a reserved port in TCP/IP networking and is not used in TCP or UDP messages. If anything attempts to bind to port 0 (such as a service), it will bind to the next available port above port 1,024 because port 0 is treated as a "wild card" port.

## Nmap
Let us start with the most basic scan. Suppose that we want to perform a basic scan against a target residing at 10.129.42.253. To do this we should type `nmap 10.129.42.253` and hit return. We see that the `Nmap` scan was completed very quickly. This is because if we don't specify any additional options, Nmap will only scan the 1,000 most common ports by default. The scan output reveals that ports 21, 22, 80, 139, and 445 are available.

```bash
nmap <ip>
```

We can use the `-sC` parameter to specify that `Nmap` scripts should be used to try and obtain more detailed information. The `-sV` parameter instructs `Nmap` to perform a version scan. In this scan, Nmap will fingerprint services on the target system and identify the service protocol, application name, and version. The version scan is underpinned by a comprehensive database of over 1,000 service signatures. Finally, `-p-` tells Nmap that we want to scan all 65,535 TCP ports.

```bash
nmap -sV -sC -p- <ip>
```

__The `-sC` and `-sV` options also increase the duration of a scan, as instead of performing a simple TCP handshake, they perform a lot more checks.__

# Attacking Network Services

## Banner Grabbing

As previously discussed, banner grabbing is a useful technique to fingerprint a service quickly. Often a service will look to identify itself by displaying a banner once a connection is initiated. Nmap will attempt to grab the banners if the syntax `nmap -sV --script=banner <target>` is specified. We can also attempt this manually using `Netcat`. Let us take another example, using the `nc` version of `Netcat`:

![[Pasted image 20220904220259.png]]
```bash
nc -nv <ip> 21
```

## FTP

It is worth gaining familiarity with FTP, as it is a standard protocol, and this service can often contain interesting data. A `Nmap` scan of the default port for FTP (21) reveals the vsftpd 3.0.3 installation that we identified previously. Further, it also reports that anonymous authentication is enabled and that a `pub` directory is available.

### FTP to a remote server

```bash
ftp 10.129.42.253
```


## SMB

SMB (Server Message Block) is a prevalent protocol on Windows machines that provides many vectors for vertical and lateral movement. Sensitive data, including credentials, can be in network file shares, and some SMB versions may be vulnerable to RCE exploits such as [EternalBlue](https://www.avast.com/c-eternalblue). It is crucial to enumerate this sizeable potential attack surface carefully. `Nmap` has many scripts for enumerating SMB, such as [smb-os-discovery.nse](https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/smb-os-discovery.html), which will interact with the SMB service to extract the reported operating system version.

```bash
nmap --script smb-os-discovery.nse -p445 10.10.10.40
```

### Shares

SMB allows users and administrators to share folders and make them accessible remotely by other users. Often these shares have files in them that contain sensitive information such as passwords. A tool that can enumerate and interact with SMB shares is [smbclient](https://www.samba.org/samba/docs/current/man-html/smbclient.1.html). The `-L` flag specifies that we want to retrieve a list of available shares on the remote host, while `-N` suppresses the password prompt.

![[Pasted image 20220904220647.png]]
```bash
smbclient -N -L \\\\10.129.42.253
```

This reveals the non-default share `users`. Let us attempt to connect as the guest user.

![[Pasted image 20220904220704.png]]
```bash
smbclient \\\\10.129.42.253\\users
```

Access shares with user

```bash
smbclient -U bob \\\\10.129.42.253\\users
```

## SNMP

SNMP Community strings provide information and statistics about a router or device, helping us gain access to it. The manufacturer default community strings of `public` and `private` are often unchanged. In SNMP versions 1 and 2c, access is controlled using a plaintext community string, and if we know the name, we can gain access to it. Encryption and authentication were only added in SNMP version 3. Much information can be gained from SNMP. Examination of process parameters might reveal credentials passed on the command line, which might be possible to reuse for other externally accessible services given the prevalence of password reuse in enterprise environments. Routing information, services bound to additional interfaces, and the version of installed software can also be revealed.

![[Pasted image 20220904220743.png]]

```bash
snmpwalk -v 2c -c public 10.129.42.253 1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5.0
```

```bash
snmpwalk -v 2c -c private  10.129.42.253 
```

A tool such as [onesixtyone](https://github.com/trailofbits/onesixtyone) can be used to brute force the community string names using a dictionary file of common community strings such as the `dict.txt` file included in the GitHub repo for the tool.

![[Pasted image 20220904220812.png]]
```bash
onesixtyone -c dict.txt 10.129.42.254
```
