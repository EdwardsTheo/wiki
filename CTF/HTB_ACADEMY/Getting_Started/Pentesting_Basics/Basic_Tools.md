# SSH
[Secure Shell (SSH)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSH_(Secure_Shell)) is a network protocol that runs on port 22 by default and provides users such as system administrators a secure way to access a computer remotely. SSH can be configured with password authentication or passwordless using [public-key authentication](https://serverpilot.io/docs/how-to-use-ssh-public-key-authentication/) using an SSH public/private key pair. SSH can be used to remotely access systems on the same network, over the internet, facilitate connections to resources in other networks using port forwarding/proxying, and upload/download files to and from remote systems.

# Netcat
[Netcat](https://linux.die.net/man/1/nc), `ncat`, or `nc`, is an excellent network utility for interacting with TCP/UDP ports. It can be used for many things during a pentest. Its primary usage is for connecting to shells, which we'll discuss later in this module. In addition to that, `netcat` can be used to connect to any listening port and interact with the service running on that port. For example, `SSH` is programmed to handle connections over port 22 to send all data and keys. We can connect to TCP port 22 with `netcat`

There's another Windows alternative to `netcat` coded in PowerShell called [PowerCat](https://github.com/besimorhino/powercat). `Netcat` can also be used to transfer files between machines, as we'll discuss later.

# Using Vim

[Vim](https://linuxcommand.org/lc3_man_pages/vim1.html) is a great text editor that can be used for writing code or editing text files on Linux systems. One of the great benefits of using `Vim` is that it relies entirely on the keyboard, so you do not have to use the mouse, which (once we get the hold of it) will significantly increase your productivity and efficiency in writing/editing code. We usually find `Vim` or `Vi` installed on compromised Linux systems, so learning how to use it allows us to edit files even on remote systems. `Vim` also has many other features, like extensions and plugins, which can significantly extend its usage and make for a great code editor. Let's see some of the basics of `Vim`. To open a file with `Vim`, we can add the file name after it.
