When performing service scanning, we will often run into web servers running on ports 80 and 443. Webservers host web applications (sometimes more than 1) which often provide a considerable attack surface and a very high-value target during a penetration test. Proper web enumeration is critical, especially when an organization is not exposing many services or those services are appropriately patched.

## Gobuster

After discovering a web application, it is always worth checking to see if we can uncover any hidden files or directories on the webserver that are not intended for public access. We can use a tool such as [ffuf](https://github.com/ffuf/ffuf) or [GoBuster](https://github.com/OJ/gobuster) to perform this directory enumeration. Sometimes we will find hidden functionality or pages/directories exposing sensitive data that can be leveraged to access the web application or even remote code execution on the web server itself.

#### Directory/File Enumeration

GoBuster is a versatile tool that allows for performing DNS, vhost, and directory brute-forcing. The tool has additional functionality, such as enumeration of public AWS S3 buckets. For this module's purposes, we are interested in the directory (and file) brute-forcing modes specified with the switch `dir`. Let us run a simple scan using the `dirb` `common.txt` wordlist.

```bash
gobuster dir -u http://10.10.10.121/ -w /usr/share/dirb/wordlists/common.txt
```

#### DNS Subdomain Enumeration

There also may be essential resources hosted on subdomains, such as admin panels or applications with additional functionality that could be exploited. We can use `GoBuster` to enumerate available subdomains of a given domain using the `dns` flag to specify DNS mode. First, let us clone the SecLists GitHub [repo](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists), which contains many useful lists for fuzzing and exploitation:

```bash
ChefBaki@htb[/htb]$ git clone https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists
```

```bash
sudo apt install seclists -y
```
